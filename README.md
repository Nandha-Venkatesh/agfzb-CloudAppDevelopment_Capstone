# How to run: (Written by Nandhakumar Venkatesh)

# PRE-REQUISITES:

    1. Make sure that nodejs and node package manager are installed on your system. NPM usually comes with installations of Node.js.

    2. Make sure that Python3 and PIP are installed on your system. Pip usually comes with installations of Python.

# You will need to open 3 terminals.

# TERMINAL 1:
    1. CD into the agfzb-CloudAppDevelopment_Capstone/functions directory.

    2. Run the following commands:
        a) npm init -y
        b) npm install -s @cloudant/cloudant
        c) npm install express
        d) node get-dealership.js

    3. Check the URL http://localhost:3000/dealerships/get. If you see a list of car dealerships, the server is running properly.

# TERMINAL 2:
    1. CD into the agfzb-CloudAppDevelopment_Capstone/functions directory.

    2A) If you are on Linux, run the following commands:
        a) bash setup.sh
        b) python3.9 reviews.py

    2B) If you are not on Linux, run the following commands:
        a) pip install Cloudant
        b) pip install Flask
        c) python reviews.py 
        (Note: You might have to install Python3.9 and write python3.9 instead of Python for the final command).

    3. Check the URL http://localhost:5000/api/get_reviews?id=15. If you see a list of reviews, the server is running properly.

# TERMINAL 3:
    1. CD into the agfzb-CloudAppDevelopment_Capstone/server directory.
    
    2. Run the following commands:
        a) python -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt
        b) python manage.py makemigrations djangoapp
        c) python manage.py migrate
        d) python manage.py runserver
        (Note: If using the python commands don't work, try writing python3 instead of python).

Finally, open a link to http://localhost:8000/djangoapp/ on localhost to see the app! Replace "djangoapp" with "admin" to view the Django Admin Site! If something isn't working, refresh the page. Unfortunately, the connection to the IBM databases can be spotty. Look at the outputs in your terminals and check all the URLs listed above. If one of the URLs isn't displaying data, there is a connection issue.

# TO CLOSE THE APP:
    1. Press control+c in each of the three terminals you opened to close the server connections.

NOTE: This project will only work as long as my free IBM trial lasts ðŸ˜”
